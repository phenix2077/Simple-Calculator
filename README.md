# Simple-Calculator
This program will do simple calculation like addition, substraction, multiplication or division.
# Project detail
- First of all, I will write a simple code that takes input from the user then do simple operation.
- Then, I will try to add more complex operation like square root, power, Logarithm, absolute value, modulo, percentage...

I will add as i am working on it update of what new.

# update
the program is now working with only simple task calculaation (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
now the next step is to add the modulo, square root, n root, and the power operation. working on it this week.

Today I changed the structure of my program by using a tools on VScode and change some terminologies to make more professional.
I also add the power operation. It took some time for me to figure out how to add it without distroying the simple operation. you take a 
look if you want to understand better but basically, i separed the simple operation to the complexe one. 
Now I quiet understood the way to perform, i will add some more complexe operation.
See you soon :)

Today I changed again the structure to make it easy to read and to understand.
I also did a great changement on the general structure. before, there was many decision like: "do you want to use simple operation"... 
now, there is only one menu with all operation. I found a way to use efficiently functions and same variable for every operation. so
I can save storage, make my code easy to maintain. 
I add also the square root operation. Now my goal is to add cube root (cbrt) and n-th root which is more complicate to perform. I am
now working on it.
See you soon ;)

Yes, I am working more these three days and it's because I am done with my exams. Any way, today i add the modulus operator and it was 
complicated because modulus only return integers (int) so i created two more variables for modulus (num1 and num2) as you can see in the 
source code. So... yeah, that's all for today.
See you soon 😄 (I just discover that i can add emoji 😆).



### The goal of this program is to practice, and to understand C++. we will try to use tools as many as possible C++ can alowed us to do. follow my growing in c++;
