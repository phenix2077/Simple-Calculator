# Simple-Calculator
This program will do simple calculation like addition, substraction, multiplication or division.
# Project detail
- First of all, we will write a simple code that takes input from the user then do simple operation.
- Then, will will try to add more complex operation like square root, power, Logarithm, absolute value, modulo, percentage...

I will add as i am working on it update of what new.

# update
the program is now working with only simple task calculaation (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
now the next step is to add the modulo, square root, n root, and the power operation. working on it this week.


The goal of this program is to practice, and to understand C++. we will try to use tools as many as possible C++ can alowed us to do.
follow my growing in c++;
